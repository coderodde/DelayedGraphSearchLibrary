# DelayedGraphSearchLibrary

### Library objective

**`DelayedGraphSearchLibrary`** provides the facilities for efficient shortest path search in graphs in which expanding a node (generating the neighbours of a node) is slow (of order at least several milliseconds). The search algorithm empowers two speed up techniques:

 - bidirectional search,
 - multithreading.
